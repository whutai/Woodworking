          As a woodworker/cabinet maker for the last 30 years or so, I think
          this is a great list. I'd like to add a few little extra bits of my
          own, if I may, in no particular order:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. You can never have too many clamps.<br />
          <span>

            >
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Table saw - if you're buying a small table saw, get one that allows
          you to change the blade from the top. Might sound like a no brainer,
          but some small saws require the whole machine to be flipped over to
          change the blade which is a nuisance, believe me, especially if it is
          on a stand.
          <br />

            >
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Cutting tools - buy decent cutting tools, whether they be saw
          blades, router bits, drill bits, whatever. Buying cheap ones is a
          false economy as they go blunt really fast and will either give crappy
          cuts or you'll have to change them more often. Same with glue - buy
          decent glue. It'll hold way better than cheap stuff.
          <br />

          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The drill press - the floor standing ones are great, but keep in
          mind some manufacturers offer a bench top version of their floor
          standing drills. I have a big Record Power pillar drill that has a 3
          foot post instead of 6 feet. This allowed me to make a heavy duty
          drawer unit on wheels so I have the height and power of the floor
          standing drill, but with storage for all the drill bits, sanding drums
          etc and, if I need to, I can move it easily. I have never needed to
          use the full height of the bed (who needs to drill through 3 feet?) so
          it works really well.
          <br />

          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          5. You can never have too many clamps. <br />
          <span>
            <a href="https://amzn.to/3rka76F" target="_blank">
              Amazon</a
            >
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Band saws - if you're buying floor standing shop tools, a band saw
          is very useful and should be considered in addition to the items in
          the video.
          <br />
          <span>
            <a href="https://amzn.to/3GoxmRo" target="_blank">
              Amazon</a
            >
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Routers - to reiterate what was said in the video, routers are
          incredibly flexible tools that will massively increase the scope of
          what you can do with your projects. They can be a bit scary, but as
          long as you stick to the recommended speeds, make shallow cuts and
          don't do anything silly, they're quite safe to use.
          <br />

            >
          </span>
        </p>
        </p>
        <p>
          8. Shop vac - worth looking at if you're going to be using power
          tools. These machines can create a huge amount of dust and chips, and
          a shop vac will help alleviate that and make tidying up much easier.
          <br />

            >
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          9. Biscuit joinery - as well as pocket hole screws, you might want to
          look at biscuit joinery, especially for cabinet making. It removes the
          need for screws, nails etc and creates very strong, completely
          invisible joints.

        <p>10. You can never have too many clamps. <br />
